      <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
      <p>
        Bootstrap is the popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing a responsive and mobile friendly website. Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing a responsive and mobile friendly website. It is absolutely free to download and use. It is a front-end framework used for easier and faster web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many others. It can also use JavaScript plug-ins. It facilitates you to create responsive designs.(Gaikwad and Adkar, 2019)
      <p>
        The bootstrap is a statistical method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data. It treats the observed data as if they were the population from which resamples are drawn to evaluate the distribution of the statistic of interest. This method can be used to estimate distributions, coverage probabilities of confidence intervals, and rejection probabilities of hypothesis tests more accurately than traditional first-order asymptotic approximations.

    <summary>Advantages</summary>
    <div class="body">
      <ul>
        <li>Provides estimations of the distribution of estimators or test statistics by resampling data, which is often easier than deriving asymptotic distributions mathematically.</li>
        <li>Can reduce bias and mean-square error of estimators in finite samples.</li>
        <li>Applicable in complicated or non-standard statistical scenarios where asymptotic theory is difficult to apply (e.g., specification tests, time-series models, semiparametric and nonparametric contexts).</li>
        <li>Flexible: works with parametric and nonparametric estimators and models.</li>
        <li>Alternatives like subsampling improve consistency when the standard bootstrap fails.</li>

  <h2>Disadvantages of Bootstrap</h2>

  <details class="accordion" open>
    <summary>Disadvantages</summary>
    <div class="body">
      <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap consistency requires certain regularity conditions; it can fail with heavy-tailed distributions, non-smooth statistics, or parameters on boundaries.</li>
        <li>The bootstrap sometimes performs poorly with poorly correlated instruments in instrumental variables estimation — higher-order terms may dominate, reducing accuracy.</li>
        <li>Implementation details matter (e.g., recentering in GMM, block length choice in dependent data) and can be complex.</li>
        <li>Computational intensity can be high, especially with bootstrap iteration or when many replications are needed.</li>
        <li>It may be sensitive to variance estimators' instability, as in estimating covariance structures.</li>
