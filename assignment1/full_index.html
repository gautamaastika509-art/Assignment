      <h2>What is full-stack development?</h2>
      <p>
        Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of
        applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend
        (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to
        user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the
        application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other
        applications, and processing data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for
        frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both
        disciplines—meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and
        cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both
        frontend and backend in a single code base.

      <h2>Benefits of full-stack development</h2>

      <details class="accordion" open>
        <summary>Efficient resource utilization</summary>
        <div class="body">
          Traditional setups require separate developers for frontend, backend, database management,
          and sometimes server operations. Full-stack developers can span UI, server-side scripting,
          and databases—reducing specialized roles, simplifying coordination, and aligning the
          project vision across teams.

      </details>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary>Flexibility and speed</summary>
        <div class="body">
          Full-stack developers rapidly build MVPs and iterate in agile environments. Because they
          can change frontend and backend together, time-to-market improves and teams can react to
          opportunities faster.

      </details>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary>Enhanced problem-solving</summary>
        <div class="body">
          With system-wide understanding, full-stack developers spot bottlenecks across layers,
          switch context as needed, and help during incidents by working on whichever layer is
          blocking progress.
