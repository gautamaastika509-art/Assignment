      <h2>What is JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
       JavaScript is a client, side scripting language mainly used for front end web development but evolving with increasing demands. It is an interpreted, lightweight, case-sensitive scripting language with key features like event handling and flexible browser integration. Its advantages include fast client-side execution, support for modern browsers, and wide application support. Some of the disadvantages are limited suitability for large-scale applications (needs tools like TypeScript), visible client code, and possible execution delays due to error handling in browsers. The paper emphasizes how programmer techniques influence the use of JavaScript's dynamic features. Advantages include fast client-side execution, support for modern browsers, and wide application support.
      <p>
        JavaScript is flexible language which can be used to develop web server, mobile application and desktop apps. It's necessary to have knowledge of ES5 and ES2015. We are not able to use syntax from ES2015 when we debug in our browser console. In the documentation and example code of libraries, some of code we will discuss below, are written in ES2015. We take advantage that comes from the syntactic changes which is the future of JavaScript libraries, and we are pleased with the results thus far. We expand brawler support for future ES language. if we enjoying features java script that is stabilized, we find babel-preset-stage-3 is best option for us due to it is more capabilities.

      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript alone cannot be used to build large-scale web applications; additional tools like TypeScript are often required.</li>
        <li>JavaScript becomes complex in larger front-end projects, which usually depend on external libraries or frameworks.</li>
        <li>The code of JavaScript is visible to everyone in the browser, which can create security risks.</li>
        <li>If an error occurs in JavaScript code, the browser may stop executing the rest of the script.</li>
        <li>Some operations may take longer execution time, which can slow down performance.</li>
